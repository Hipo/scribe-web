						<h2>1) Restart Scribe on Mac</h2>
						<p>
							Bluetooth signals can sometimes be lost in the crowd. Quit Scribe from the top-right icon <Scribe Icon> and open it again. Give it a minute to find its bearings, if there is still no change in the link device screen, Move to Step 2
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step2">
						<h2>2) Reset Bluetooth on your devices</h2>
						<p>
							iOS (7.0 and up): The swipe up menu <screenshot> has a Bluetooth icon. Press once to turn off Bluetooth, press again to turn it on. Alternatively, you can go to Settings > Bluetooth and turn off/on from there
							<br><br>
							MAC: Click on the Bluetooth Icon on the top bar and select "Turn Bluetooth Off". Click again on the Icon and turn it back on.
							<br><br>
							Still no luck? Move on to Step 3
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step3">
						<h2>3) Restart your Mac (or its Bluetooth software)</h2>
						<p>
							The simple way to do this is to just restart your Mac. If you're not into that, you can also open your Activity Monitor, find the process called "blued", select it, and press Force Quit. That should restart your Bluetooth. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Still not working? Move on to Step 4.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step4">
						<h2>4) Restart your iPhone</h2>
						<p>
							When the Bluetooth framework is faulty on the iPhone, the only way is to restart it. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Did none of these work? Really? Then you should probably <a href="mailto:hello@usescribe.com">send us an email</a>.

						<h2>1) Make sure you haven't erased Scribe from your iOS Dock</h2>
						<p>
							Apple's latest iOS version forbids apps from running in the background when they are erased from dock (which is accessed by double-tapping the home button). If you erase Scribe from your dock manually, you'll have to re-launch Scribe for your iOS device to be visible to your Mac again. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Still having trouble? Move to Step 2
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step2">
						<h2>2) Check that Bluetooth is turned on for your iOS device</h2>
						<p>
							Scribe uses Low Energy Bluetooth technology to link your devices. On your iOS device, Bluetooth settings can be accessed by the swipe-up menu (for iOS 7.0 and above) or through Settings > Bluetooth.
							<br>
							<br>
							If it's already on, move to step 3.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step3">
						<h2>3) Unlink devices on Mac and iOS</h2>
						<p>
							First unlink your Mac by clicking on the Scribe Icon on the top bar and then on "Unlink Device". Your iPhone should unlink automatically. If it doesn't, unlink on the iPhone app through the top-left menu and tapping on Unlink. Stay on the Link Device screen (on both your Mac and your iOS device) and wait for your devices to see each other again.
							<br>
							<br>
							Waited too long? go to the Previous Scenario.

						<h2>1) Check your Mac's Bluetooth LE compatibility</h2>
						<p>
							Although the iPhone App Store does not allow downloads with devices that don't support Bluetooth LE, the Mac App Store does not seem to extend the same courtesy of checking your Mac's Bluetooth LE compatibility. We have put up a compatibility list on the site, where you can check your Mac's version. If you're not sure, you can simply click on the Apple icon on the top left, click on "About This Mac", and then on "More Info..." Your Mac's model will appear there. 
							<br>
							<br>
							If your Mac is not compatible with Bluetooth LE, we're sorry for the inconvenience. Steps 2-4 will guide you on how to get your refund.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step2">
						<h2>2) Enter Apple's <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">Report a Problem tool</a></h2>
						<p>
							Don't worry, getting a refund isn't that hard. Just enter <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>, sign in with your Apple ID.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step3">
						<h2>3) Report a problem with Scribe</h2>
						<p>
							Click on the "Apps" tab, and find "Scribe: Copy anything from your Mac to your iPhone", then click on "Report a Problem" on that row.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step animated fadeInUp step4">
						<h2>4) Select Reason</h2>
						<p>
							On the reason page, just state that the "Problem is not listed here", and copy this text: "Scribe runs on Bluetooth LE, which my Mac and/or iOS device does not support". Tap the "Submit" button, and your refund should come pretty quickly.
